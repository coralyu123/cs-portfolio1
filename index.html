    <h2 id="h2"> My name is Coral Yu and I am a sophomore in high school.  
    I go to Summit Shasta and play basketball for the school team.
    I also do another sport called dragon boat for another high

        I play basketball on a total of three different teams including the high school
        varsity girls basketball team.  I play basketball for fun and because of the 
        competiveness it gives to me that I enjoy.
