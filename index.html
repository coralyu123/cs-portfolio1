    <h1 id="h1"> About Me</h1>

    <h2 id="h2"> My name is Coral Yu and I am a sophomore in high school.  
    I go to Summit Shasta and play basketball for the school team.
    I also do another sport called dragon boat for another high
    school team outside of school.  I don't only play for the school 
    team, but I also play in two different club teams outside of school.

    </h3>
    
    <h4 id="h4">
        I play basketball on a total of three different teams including the high school
        varsity girls basketball team.  I play basketball for fun and because of the 
        competiveness it gives to me that I enjoy.  It is also considered one of my favorite
        sports that I play.  This is also a sport that requires me to travel every once in 
        a while because of the places where the tournaments are at.  I've been to Las Vegas,
        Reno, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.

        Another hobby I have is dragon boat which is a competive sport where a lot of 
        people paddle on one boat together really fast and are timed and race against 
        other teams.  It is a very competive sport that I've started participating in last 
        year and even though I don't go to many places unlike basketball, I still get to 
        experience and participate in races that are at nearby places like Oakland or Alameda.
