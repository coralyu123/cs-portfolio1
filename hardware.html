    The motherboard is the core of the computer and it connects all
    the components of the computer together.  It is a printed circuit
    board that allows computer components to communicate with each

    CPU also known as the central processing unit, is the brain of the

    The keyboard, monitor, and mouse are what allows the users to control
    the computer they are using.  The keyboard allows users to type any
    letter, symbol, or numbers into the computer itself.  The mouse 
    is like a pointer that allows users to go to different parts of the 
    computer or choose certain things on the computer.  The monitor 
    displays everything that is typed or clicked on from the computer.
    together, they allow the user to do whatever they want on their
    computer.

    The components in the computer all work together to make the computer 
    work but how do the components actually communicate with each other?
    Well, the components in the computer communicate by using their thin
    connection on the motherboard called the "bus".  Communications where
    multiple devices are connected to one bus are handled by "bus controller"
    and devices using RAM and CPU to communicate are "bus mastering" devices.
