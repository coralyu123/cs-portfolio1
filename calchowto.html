        Step 1
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
       First you're going to make a box for your number(s).  Do this by using the following codes.
    </h2>
    
    <h3>

        Step 2
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
        The next step is to make a dropdown for the many signs you can use in your equation that you would want to put into you calculator.  Do so with these codes and feel free to customize the many different signs and fucntions you would want to use.
    </h2>
    
    <h3>

    <h1>
        Step 3
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
       Next, you're going to have to make a button so the calculator will be able to operate.  Without the button, your calculator wouldn't work because it won't start.  You would also want a space for you answer to appear.
    </h2>
    
    <h3>

    </h3>

    
    <h1>
        Step 4
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
       Now to get the buttons and functions working, you'll need javascript to help you out.  Without javascript, your buttons will not work and nothing will happen even after you click on the button to try to get the calculator working because it doesn't know what it needs to do.  Javascript will tell it what to do when the button is clicked.  In this case, you will need an Event Listener.  This tells the computer to listen for a certain sound or command to start getting the calclator working.  You'll also need to make a variable for the id's that are going to be used from your html.

    <h1>
        Step 5
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
        Now state the function of the button and list how the signs are going to function in the calculator when the button is clicked on.
